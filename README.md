Synth library inspired by Mutable Instruments Braids

Braids is a macro oscillator, it combines basic synthesis elements in
different ways to produce a wide variety of sounds.

This project aims at providing the same features as Braids in an Ada audio
synthesis library. Most of the code you will find here is a translation from
the C++ code of Braids.
